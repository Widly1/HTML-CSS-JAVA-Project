Developed a Wildlife Rescue Website & a personalized portfolio, utilizing HTML and CSS.
Created and Optimized multiple “.html” pages to ensure a smooth website functionality. 
Successfully managed and fine-tuned the “css” file for a cohesive user experience.
Gained proficiency in implementing style rules and effectively applying them to HTML pages.
Acquired skills in managing div elements and dynamically showing/hiding different classes based on the different viewports.
