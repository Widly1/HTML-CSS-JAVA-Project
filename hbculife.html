     <figcaption>This video was taken my 2021 fall semester. It was the first time I was witnessing the Great FAMU Marching 100 band in action, not only that but it was also my first time attending a college football game, and I have to say, they did not dissapoint at all. Their music choices had me amped from the moment they stepped on the field.

     <img src="images/UsherPic.jpg" alt="Me as an usher" class="round">
   <figcaption>This was one the many experiences that I have had the pleasure of being a part of. Seeing as some of my friends are Essential Theater Majors, they've always encourage me to step out of my comfort zone and do some unique once in a while. This time, I was motivated to become an Usher for the play "Romeo and Juliet: A Miami Love Story" since they were short-handed for volunteers and ushers. Taking this opportunity, I was granted with the behind the scenes look of how the actors/actresses warmed up before their big performance, I was also blessed to get a behind the scenes look at the play itself. It was a very interesting experience to say the least.</figcaption>

     <img src="images/ToniEvent.jpg" alt="Me and a beautiful actress attending the Toni Awards" class="round">
   <figcaption>This was one the most recent experiences that I was invited to by my friends who are a part of the Theater Major. We were dressed to attend the Toni's, which is a ceremony that is promoted to acknowledge and award theater students for their services to the theater department and their academic goals over the school semester. We were able to witness short films of some students displaying their acting skills on the big screen. It was as if the Grammy's were being hosted for future actresses/actors for their dedication to both school and theater, there were stars with names on them, similar to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was the closest I think I'll get to a literal Red Carpet event.</figcaption>
  <br>
 <figcaption>I know the time will come when I will have plenty more opportunities to make a lot more core memories at the prestigious Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University. One of the things that excites me most about attending FAMU is the opportunity to get involved in various extracurricular activities. Whether it's joining a student organization or participating in a community service project, FAMU offers a wide range of opportunities for students to get involved and make a difference. I am eager to explore these opportunities and develop my leadership skills as I engage with my fellow students and the broader community. I am also looking forward to taking advantage of FAMU's excellent academic programs, which will help me to develop a strong foundation of knowledge and skills that will be invaluable in my future career. Overall, I am confident that my time at FAMU will be an unforgettable and transformative experience that will shape me into a well-rounded and successful individual.</figcaption>
