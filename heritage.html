		<p>As mentioned in my biography, I am Haitian-American. On this page I will be taking the honor of introducing you to my culture/heritage, my family origin, and last but not least some of my favorite food from my culture. Although I wasn't born in Haiti, I've lived there long enough to attend some pre-school and primary school, not to mention I've spent enough time there to learn french and much more. Haiti is known for its major revolution from the French, led by some of the most popular names in Haitian history such as Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Henry Christophe. The Haitian Revolution was a successful insurrection by self-liberated slaves against French colonial rule in Saint-Domingue, now the sovereign state of Haiti. The revolt began on 22 August 1791, and ended in 1804 with the former colony's independence. This revolution even shook the U.S. because it played a huge role in the Louisiana Purchase. For decades, European powers, and later the United States, refused to recognize it as an independent republic. The Caribbean nation became the world‚Äôs first Black-led republic when it declared its independence from France on New Year‚Äôs Day 1804. That day, Saint-Domingue, once France‚Äôs richest colony, known as the ‚ÄúPearl of the Antilles,‚Äù became Haiti. Haiti underwent many changes since becoming an independent nation, most were negative impacts on the country but they managed to prevail, and truthfully I have hope that Haiti will rise once again in the future.</p>

    <figcaption> Personal Opinion: If I did have to choose a flag to represent my Haiti, I would definitely go with the flag 1964. Simply because the red and black makes it so fierce.</figcaption>
  
    <p>As for my family origin, they are based from the capital of Haiti known as Port-Au-Prince. Eventually, they decided to pursue more in the United States of America, and in Canada as well. Majority of my family members are currently located in New York, South Florida, Wisconsin, and Montreal, but much of the older generation from my family were originally from Haiti. Some examples are my mother, my father, my aunties and uncles on both sides of my family tree. I still have some family members in Haiti and we communicate often and I do hope I can visit sooner or later to see some of my family members and my childhood home.</p>

      <td>Food</td>
      <td class="Food">When it comes to food, we can never go wrong with any carribean cuisine, I personally believe Haitian food is really top tier.So many choices to choose from but if I had to narrow it down to simply three, it would be Soup Joumou (vegetable soup with meat), rice and griot (rice and fried pork with vegetables or plantains), and macaroni au gratin (think of it as a flavourful mac and cheese but a little bit cheesier sometimes with meat and vegetables).</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Beaches</td>
      <td class="Beaches">Some of the most popular beaches in Haiti include Labadee Beach, Kokoye Beach, and Wahoo Bay Beach. Labadee Beach is a private beach that features crystal-clear waters, powdery white sands, and stunning mountain views. Kokoye Beach is known for its calm waters, vibrant coral reefs, and rich marine life, making it a great spot for snorkeling and diving. Wahoo Bay Beach is a secluded beach that offers visitors a tranquil retreat with breathtaking views of the ocean and surrounding landscape.

      <td>Arts</td>
      <td class="Arts">Now my favorite thing to mention when speaking about Haiti is the art style and the beautiful way they use art to represent daily life. Haitian art is characterized by its vibrant colors, expressive forms, and rich cultural heritage. It draws on a variety of influences, including African, European, and Indigenous traditions, creating a unique and distinctive style. One of the most famous forms of Haitian art is the "naive" style, which is characterized by its childlike simplicity and directness. It often depicts scenes from everyday life, including marketplaces, rural landscapes, and religious ceremonies. Overall, Haitian art is a vibrant and dynamic reflection of the country's history, culture, and spirit, and continues to inspire and captivate audiences around the world.</td>
