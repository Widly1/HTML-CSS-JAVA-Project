		<p> Greetings, my name is Widly Delone. I am a twenty-one year-old Haitian-American from Miami, Florida. I am a junior studying Computer Science with the hopes of becoming a software engineer in the Automotive industry. My main goal once becoming a Software engineer in the automotive industry is to become part of a team that is thinking about the future of safer and more advanced vehicles. For example, Tesla became one of the safest and most advanced cars we have in our time because of the technology embedded into it, a self-driving car, and it doesn't use gasoline to run. Tesla is the future of automobiles, and we can improve it. 
</p>
		<p> Growing up, I was the last of three children, so I wouldn't get in trouble as much as my other siblings, which is when my engineering mindset started kicking in. I would listen to my parents tell me stories about how my toys wouldn't last more than a week because I was always curious about what made them work. Fast forward to my teenage years, I started building a love for cars, their engines, and the technology that made them as quickly as they were. I started researching my career path to get to where I wanted to be. After two years in a community college, I earned my associate's Degree in Mechanical Engineering. Then I transferred to Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University to gain new experience and see what it would be like to be away from home.</p>
		
    <p> After transferring to FAMU, I decided to change my major to Computer Science after realizing that it would be interesting to be a part of the tech world. Still, I also wanted to stay within my career goals and not stray away from them. At the time, I had no idea what programming was or how the transition from an M.E major to a C.S major would go as far as difficulty in classes, but it is currently working out for the best. Looking back at it now, I do not regret my decision to switch majors because the possibilities for me are endless as a computer science primary student. After all, the world relies on programmers and developers to develop something new and exciting for everyday life. Although my journey here has been challenging, I know that to achieve my dreams in life, some things will be difficult, and I plan on being the first college graduate in my family. I am glad to be attending FAMU, and I love walking on campus and seeing other minorities like myself pursue higher education regardless of their motive for doing it.</p>

      <td class="internship">Finally, this is one of my favorite pictures, which was taken while I was a part of an internship called Upward Bound Math and Science(UBMS) for High school students who were interested in STEM. This internship lasted all four years of my high school and I genuinely enjoyed every single year. It taught me discipline, how to write short research papers, helped me with my presentation skills, and much more. In my senior year of high school I had the opportunity to work with college researchers at the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. Which increased my knowledge on marine biology and the different kinds of marine life out in the ocean and how they impact each other. </td>
